title: How do I Markdown?

Word Documents seem to have taken over as the only way to make documents, at least for the majority of people. If someone is at a computer and you tell them to write something down they are most likely going to open up a fresh word document and start typing away. It's slow, but it's easy and that seems to be the number one priority. But how about us, the people who are willing to buck standards in order to do things more efficiently? Thats where markdown comes in. A language specifically made for writing on the web. No more pure html text editors, or rich text editors that require you to click on things whenever you want to change the formatting of something. As developers we are used to seeing something in plain text, then seeing it come to live when compiled or some other way of previewing it.

Well with markdown you get the more efficient way of typing, or at least I think so, especially when the world is moving to a more technology based era.

The problem is, I now have to learn how to use markdown. The syntax seems pretty simple at least, but I think it'll be worth it. When taking notes in class I think I'm going to do them in markdown for efficiency reasons. So I'm going to need to learn the syntax before September. To write this I am currently using prose, a great editor for Github based Jekyll blogs, as it has some shortcuts to make this more like a rich text editor, but I don't think I will be using it for long. The first post I made ended up looking like a block of code and the entire post just went far off the screen. So I have some work to do, but I think markdown has a lot of potential for efficiency.

A few years back I purchase Omm writer Da√±a as I was in search of a nicer writing environment to learn how to type correctly, it was nice but it still had too much to it that just felt unnecessary. Then I stumbled upon Ai writer, which was my first introduction to markdown files. It's the simplicity I was looking for, the way its simplifies writing to such a simple form. It is what I will be doing most of my note taking in for university. When it comes to writing essays and less casual writing I will be using Writer Pro, an app by the same developer. It has some unparalleled features like splitting workflow into 4 different stages, as well as having a great clean interface. In the edit mode is has a feature that allows you to highlight all adjectives, nouns and more on their own so they can be improved upon. It seems like the best writing environment for making truly polished writing.

Word documents aren't the be all end all of typing, there is a reason why George R. R. Martin still uses Vi (or vim, I forget) to write his books. There is a reason to why Github uses markdown for readme files. There is something about the simplicity of it that makes it a much nicer environment, as well as its power to turn into html so easily.

I'm excited to jump into the world of markdown.
