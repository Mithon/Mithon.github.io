subtitle: 'Tooling, AR, 3D, interactive objects, and generative art'
---
Recently I've been exploring design & development in spaces that are new to me. I've been focusing on physical computing, 3D, AR, generative art and how I can tie them together.

I've been documenting my process on an custom Gatsby site: [ThreeDee.party](http://threedee.party/) (In-progress, currently desktop-only).

## Learning 3D and AR

I started off creating some small explorations while doing a Udacity course on 3D development. This led me to try and create cool things without knowing how to properly light or model anything. Small things like [this](http://threedee.party/3D-experiments/003/) helped me understand the potential of 3D design.

As a designer, I almost instantly wanted to try working with typography & interactivity. This led me to create simple experiments like [this](http://threedee.party/3D-experiments/010/).
Around this time I discovered the beginnings of Web AR, and instantly fell in love.

</div>

##### Experimenting with Web AR — Better Quality Video in Tweet [Here](https://twitter.com/huntercaron/status/922627031166103553)

AR is changing fast and is starting to feel closer than ever to a mainstream technology. We're at a fantastic time in the community because of this. I tweeted out one of my first AR creations (above) got noticed by the creators of THREE.js and Google's web XR team. The experiment was shown briefly on stage at the Chrome dev summit this year. Showing how developer experimentation is going to be such a key part of AR growth.

Recently I've been experimenting with re-imagining the use of some APIs in AR. Starting with playing around visualizing my instagram feed in AR.

    <source src="/img/ar_002.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
    AR Video
  </video>
</div>

##### Placing my Instagram posts around me

AR is an exciting space that I'm glad to be experimenting with at such an exciting time.

## Physical Computing
Physical computing is a new endeavour for me, but has really opened up the way I approach projects. I’ve been incredibly drawn to how physical interaction communicates conceptual ideas in such a personal and intimate way.

I've done a few physical computing projects so far, but they have been stayed in the proof of concept stage for the most part.

##### Heart rate light

My most recent experiment is part of a larger experiment where I am re-interpreting physical objects into digital space to show a new perspective on the objects in our everyday life. Using various sensors I was able to abstract the physical attributes of an object and create a generative drawing in P5.js.

  <video autoPlay muted loop preload >
    <source src="/img/physical_003.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>
    AR Video
  </video>
</div>

##### (still super early in the visualizing stage)

I plan on casing the project in a more friendly way, as well as creating a companion mobile web app that will show the P5 sketch in real time in AR beside the object. This would allow the user to juxtapose the object in space.

## Conclusion
My thesis research is taking place in the realm of creativity and how it is affecting by tooling. I think things like 3D, AR, VR, and physical computing will have an incredible impact on how we think and create. I hope to help shape that space for the best.

I'm going to keep exploring in these spaces, and improving upon the projects I've started. Stay tuned!
