Recently I've been exploring design & development in spaces that are new to me. I've been focusing on physical computing, 3D, AR, generative art and how I can tie them together.

I've been documenting my process on an custom Gatsby site: [ThreeDee.party](http://threedee.party/) (In-progress, currently desktop-only).

## Learning 3D and AR

I started off creating some small explorations while doing a Udacity course on 3D development. This led me to try and create cool things without knowing how to properly light or model anything. Small things like [this](http://threedee.party/3D-experiments/003/) helped me understand the potential of 3D.

As a designer, I almost instantly wanted to try working with typography & interactivity which led me to create simple experiments like [this](http://threedee.party/3D-experiments/010/).
This was around the time when I discovered the beginnings of Web AR, and instantly fell in love.

##### Experimenting with Web AR â€” Better Quality Video in Tweet [Here](https://twitter.com/huntercaron/status/922627031166103553)

AR is changing fast and is starting to feel like closer than ever to a mainstream technology. We're at a fantastic time in the community because of this. I tweeted out one of my first AR creations (above), which got picked up my the creators of THREE.js and Google's web XR team.

The experiment was shown briefly on stage at the Chrome dev summit this year. Showing how developer experimentation is going to be such a key part of AR growth.

Recently I've been experimenting with re-imagining the use of some APIs in AR. Starting with playing around visualizing my instagram feed in AR.
