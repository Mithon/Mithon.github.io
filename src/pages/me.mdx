Hi, I'm Hunter

I'm a Canadian designer living in Amsterdam.
I currently work @ Framer, a web based prototyping tool.

I like to build things for people striving to succeed in what makes them unique.

This extends into a few themes in my work
- Building tools for creative people that helps them create their best work
- Creating tight, polished & intuitive designs
- Teaching & helping others to create compelling things
- Exploring new ideas & technologies

Below you can find a selection of my work in no particular order.
I would normally go over these in person so please feel free to get in touch.
