title: Attack of the Bloat

	There are few things I dislike more than bloat. It follows us around and destroys creativity and productivity. Not only does it eat away at the back of my mind it also eats away at resources. When it comes to web design resource optimization is key. For instance my closet is filled with bloat, it's not nearly as organized as I would like it to be, which makes it hard to find things. When a website is bloated, its takes longer to load. Bloat doesn't make it better for anyone.

	This is where jekyll and github come in to save the day. As you may know I used to have a blog on wordpress, that didn't get much action. It loaded slow, had spam comments and was just not a pleasureable experience. Yeah maybe is has better seo discoverability but honestly, I'd rather put more work into promotion than have a ton of bloat following me around and giving me horrible loading speeds. The amazing part about Jekyll is that is compiles my posts into native html on the fly so it doesn't have to do some funking php stuff all the time and be a huge resource hog. It's simple, and its exactly what I want. A simple blog.
    
    Simplicity is key, which is why I'm here. I'll have to find the quote from Matias Duarte that is along these lines, but I'm gonna end this with my version of the quote, or rather how I interpreted it.
