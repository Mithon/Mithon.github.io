Hi, I'm Hunter

I'm a Canadian designer living in Amsterdam.
I currently work @ Framer, a web based prototyping tool.

I like to build things for people striving to succeed in what makes them unique.

This extends into a few themes in my work
- Building tools for creative people to help them create their best work
- Creating tight, polished & intuitive designs
- Teaching & helping others to create compelling things
- Exploring new ideas & technologies

Below you can find a selection of my work in no particular order.
I would normally go over these in person so please feel free to get in touch.

BLOOM: VIEW
A minimal constraint based tool for viewing inspiriation. It helps you view your collected insipration in a purely forward & random matter, not allowing you to dwell for too long on any singular reference.

TEDTALK.DIRECTORY 
A website for exploring the content of Ted talks by searching for any word or phrase. This allows you to see patterns in the talks with them vertically mapped from top to bottom. You can hover to view the matched phrase & talk or click to go to the talk itself at that timestamp.

MARKED.SITE
Saba Sobhani & I created [MARKED.SITE](https://huntercaron.github.io/MARKED.SITE/), an art experiment at scale. People are given prompts to draw, and can submit to a public feed below. After being live for just over a day, Saba compiled a printed book of the submissions (which can be seen on [his site](http://sabasobhani.com/)).
